# Andez_e-Commerce

## Overview
The Andez e-commerce site is a web application built with React, Next.js, Python, and SQL. It provides a platform for buying and selling items online. The site includes features such as user registration, login and logout, shopping cart functionality, and transaction history. Users can add Site Coins to their account using a fake credit card and use them to purchase items listed on the site. Items for sale are listed with details such as name, price, description, and vendor. Transactions are recorded with the user, items purchased, total price, and transaction date. Refunds can also be issued for specific items.

As a stretch goal, the application includes Vendors, who have their own page with their name, items for sale, and reviews. This adds an extra layer of functionality to the site and allows users to view and purchase items from specific vendors.

Congrats, you are now configured and ready to run this program!

## Instructions:
### How to Start the program
React:
TBD

Python/Flask:
From the root folder of this project, in the command line of your terminal...
Type: chmod +x lib/seed.py (to unlock permisions)
Type: lib/seed.py (to populate the database. Otherwise the game will be empty.)
Type: chmod +x lib/main.py (to unlock permisions)
Type: lib/main.py

And it begins!

### How to access the programs Functions:
TBD


## Assignment Goals
As per the Project Pitch Template:

Done! - Use a Flask API backend with a React frontend.
    Can be improved. But, there is a backend and a React frontend... though they can be fleshed out further.
    

Done! - Have at least three models on the backend, that include the following:
    At least two one-to-many relationships.
        User to Transaction. Item to Transaction. Vendor to VendorItem. Item to VendorItem.
    At least one reciprocal many-to-many relationship.
        Users to Items through Transactions. Vendors to Items through VendorItems

Done! - Full CRUD actions for at least one resource.
    Create:
        User signup creates a db entry
        Item created in Add Item Tab (admin only)
        Vendor created in Add Vendor Tab (admin only)

    Read:
        Users can be all seen in Users Tab (admin only)
        Items can be viewed in Items Tab
        Vendors can be viewed in Vendors Tab

    Update:
        Users account balance, email, and address can all be changed in Users Tab (admin only)

    Delete:
        Users can be deleted through the Users Tab (admin only)
        Items can be deleted in their Detail (admin only)
        Vendors can be deleted in their Detail (admin only)

In Progress... Minimum of create and read actions for EACH resource.
    Create and Read done for Users, Items, and Vendors. Still need Transactions and Vendor Items.

Done! - Use at least 1 validations on the Backend tables
    So many that I wont list them all here. 

Done! - Have at least three different client-side routes using React Router. 
    Be sure to include a nav bar or other UI element that allows users to navigate between routes.
        NavBar has 3 routes for Users, and an additional 3 for Admin
        

Done! - Connect the client and server using fetch().
    Many connections (for the CRUD above)

Done! - Implement Authorization
    - Password Hash is present. 
    - Invalid users are denied login, and receive a message saying they are not valid. 
    - Sections of the app are not accessible unless one is an authorized admin

In Progress... Have a clear readMe with:
    Done! - An Overview about what your project is about
    Instructions for running your project
    Instructions for using your project

Done! - Demonstrate good git practices with your partner
    We have all sorts of adds, commits, pushes, branches and merges. 


## Project Pitch/Ideas. 

The Andez e-commerce site is a web application built with React, Next.js, Python, and SQL. It provides a platform for buying and selling items online. The site includes features such as user registration, login and logout, shopping cart functionality, and transaction history. Users can add Site Coins to their account using a fake credit card and use them to purchase items listed on the site. Items for sale are listed with details such as name, price, description, and vendor. Transactions are recorded with the user, items purchased, total price, and transaction date. Refunds can also be issued for specific items.

As a stretch goal, the application includes Vendors, who have their own page with their name, items for sale, and reviews. This adds an extra layer of functionality to the site and allows users to view and purchase items from specific vendors.

To set up the database schema, we need to identify the entities and their relationships. Based on the requirements provided, we can identify the following entities: Users, Items, Transactions, and Vendors. We can represent these entities using three tables: Users, Items, and Transactions. We can then create an additional table for Vendors to establish a many-to-many relationship.

Here's how we can set up the tables:
Users table: user_id (primary key), username, password, email, shipping_address, account_balance
Items table: item_id (primary key), name, price, description, vendor_id (foreign key referencing the Vendors tableâ€¦ maybe)
Transactions table: transaction_id (primary key), user_id (foreign key referencing the Users table) ,item_id (foreign key referencing the Items table), item_price, transaction_date, total_price, refund boolean, update_date for refund.

Stretch Goal: 
Vendors table: vendor_id (primary key), Vendor_name
VendorItems table: vendor_id (foreign key referencing the Vendors table), item_id (foreign key referencing the Items table)

In this schema, the Users table has a one-to-many relationship with the Transactions table since a user can have many transactions. The Items table also has a one-to-many relationship with the Transactions table since an item can be sold in multiple transactions. The Transactions table also establishes a many-to-many relationship between users and items since a user can purchase multiple items, and an item can be purchased by multiple users.

The Vendors table establishes a many-to-many relationship with the Items table since a vendor can sell multiple items, and an item can be sold by multiple vendors. We can represent this relationship using a junction table:

This schema allows us to efficiently store and retrieve information for the Andez e-commerce site while maintaining data integrity and minimizing redundancy.
